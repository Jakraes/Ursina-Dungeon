# Ursina-Dungeon

I have already made a **Random Dungeon Generator** in the past with Python, which was then finished and translated into Javascript and back into Python once again, and since Ursina is great for the 3D representation of this project, I decided to use it.

It's still pretty raw since the translation from Javascript to Python isn't as linear as I wish it could be but it's alright and ready to use.

When you first launch the app, you'll be able to see the map in the Python console, and it should look similar to this:
```
....................
....................
....................
....................
....................
.......#####....####
.......#___#....#__#
.......#___######__#
.......#___________#
..######___####____#
###_____#_##..#____#
#_______#_##########
#_________________#.
#_______#_#########.
#_______###.........
#____####...........
#____#..............
######..............
....................
....................
```

Each character has a meaning if you're interested in creating a non random custom map:
```
# is a wall
_ is floor
. is empty space
```

Press Shift to run to speed up your exploration and press F if you're stuck on the ground or fall through it.

Feel free to contribute if you find the project interesting.
